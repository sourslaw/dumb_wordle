# Dumb Wordle

## Description
This is a silly script that utilizes Playwright to play the Wordle word of the day on the first attempt.

## Note
Since the New York Times aquisition of Wordle, this no longer functions correctly as the word list has been modified and the word of the day may no longer be derived in quite the same manner. Most likely a simple fix; however, I leave that up to you . . .
